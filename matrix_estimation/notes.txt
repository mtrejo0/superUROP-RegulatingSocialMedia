Second, I think I've come around to focusing on data for a bit. 
My thinking is that if you can get your hands on a lot of social 
media data, as might be able to show some results more immediately,
 which would be nice for the your projects

So, for the next few days, could you guys (1) get familiar with twitter
 data and (2) write some preliminary code that recommends tweets to a 
 user. Then, we'll start manipulating that data next week to see what
  a regulation of the form we were talking about would look like.

(your current projects won't be abandoned -- I'll spend some time
 filling in a few steps that I need to do first)
