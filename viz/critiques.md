# A5 Self & Partner Critiques
The self & partner critiques are an important exercise for your pair to reflect and provide feedback on both partner's contributions to the assignment (design, code implementation, reflections, collaboration, and effort). You should provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement your partner can make on future assignments in this course and beyond and/or commend them for their contributions and collaboration. It also an exercise for you to evaluate your own contributions & efforts in the assignment.

Before you submit the assignment, please discuss and review the partner critiques as a pair so both of you reach mutual understanding of what worked, what didn't, and how things can be improved. This is meant to be a constructive, reflective, and collaborative session.

The self critique & partner critique should take somewhere between 10-15 minutes to complete and the pair discussion & review of the partner critiques should be somewhere between 5-7 minutes. 

**If you worked individually, just fill out all the sections for *Partner 1* except the *Partner Critique* & *Authorship* sections.**
# Partner 1
## Info
**Name**:  Moises Trejo

**Email address (kerberos username or primary email if cross-reg)**:  moisest@mit.edu
## Reflection (Please provide just a few sentences)
**What did you learn from this assignment?**

I learned how to use an api to work with a front end frame work to make an application, using everything weve built up until this point

**What was hard or easy?**

Hard to decide what design between my parter and I was best
refreshing the feed once an action was made

Easy to build out UI once you know what can work
making new components and relating them
 
**How many hours did you spend on this assignment?**

15 hrs

**Any suggestions for how we might improve it?** 

Maybe reduce the number of concepts we have to build out the three extra ones were beefy maybe only require  2/3

**Any other feedback?**

If you gave everyone the same fritter api maybe that would be cool so we can all focus on the same api and focus more on the UI

## Self Critique (single paragraph)
**Please evaluate your contributions to the assignment. Critique your design, implementation, and effort.**

I like how I payed extra attention to the colors of the design to be consistent in the whole application. I wish the backend was refactored to make error handling easier and unifrom throughout the project. What if there was a way to reduce the number of enpoints in the backend to develop the front end easier. 

I did about half I made the sign in, sign out, freet list and the freet components and connected them. The design was very nice its clean and minimal to allow users to navigate the concepts we present. This took quite a long time bc of how much front end we had to build out while also tuning the backend.

My partner did a lot as well they did the following, user search, and user settings edit

Their design for the UI was good we based a lot of it on their previous design while encorporating some of my previous design. Their implementation for following and seach was nice it was done in just a few components, They put a lot of effort into the project we met often to make sure we were on track and they supposrted me a lot

## Reflection (Please provide just a few sentences)
**What did you learn from this assignment?**

I really liked learning about front end work in this assignment. It was fun creating the different components and realizing how it all works behind the scenes.

**What was hard or easy?**

Having all the reactive components of Vue work together was a pain, since I didn't fully understand how everything fit in initially. It took a lot of trial and error to get the hang of it.
 
**How many hours did you spend on this assignment?**

18 hrs

**Any suggestions for how we might improve it?** 

There was fairly little handholding here, but I think it worked well to help us learn on our own.

**Any other feedback?**

No

## Self Critique (single paragraph)
**Please evaluate your contributions to the assignment. Critique your design, implementation, and effort.**

I liked the way I wired up some of the components/views. I also put in a lot of effort into this assignment. However, I think that I could've done better in the CSS department; some of the components didn't reuse classes and share properties as much as they could've. I wonder if I could've used some other packages that could make styling easier on me.

I enjoyed working with Moises. He was always there to meet up or talk about any issues that I had. His work was always great as well; it was always consistent with whatever style or convention I decided to go with in the beginning, so there were no communication issues whatsoever. He was also pretty knowledgeable with the backend and setting up a lot of reactive components, so he saved us a lot of time by setting up a good framework.
